# Contributing to Simple Shell

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Simple Shell as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code follows the existing style.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Code Style

* Use 4 spaces for indentation
* Follow the Betty style guide for C
* Keep functions under 40 lines
* Use descriptive variable names
* Comment complex logic
* Each file should have a header comment explaining its purpose

## Bug Reports

Use GitHub issues to report bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue.

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the same license as the original project.
